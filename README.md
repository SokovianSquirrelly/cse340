## Introduction
This is a project I was working on while learning web backend development while I was a student at BYU-Idaho.  It's a mock e-commerce website for selling cars, though I'm sorry to say, you're not actually going to get a car by shopping here, so if you come shopping for the Mystery Machine from Scooby-Doo, I don't actually have one of those casually sitting in my garage, so you're out of luck.

## Accounts
Some features of this project are locked behind certain accounts.  This is because some features can only be accessed by a site admin or site employee.  The three types of accounts with this site are customer, employee, or manager.  Here's a breakdown of what each one can do:

### Customer
- Update their account information including password
- "Shop" for vehicles that have been approved by a manager

### Employee
- Everything the customer can do
- Add, update, or remove vehicles and vehicle classifications from the database (they must be approved by a manager in order to appear on the site to everyone)

### Manager
- Everything the customer and employee can do
- Approve vehicles and classifications that have been added by an employee

I also have login information for each account.  Feel free to play around with the site and don't worry about updating or deleting too much.  I have the backup SQL files to restore the database.
